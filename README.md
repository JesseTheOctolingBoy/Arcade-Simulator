# Arcade-Simulator
A Github repository containing things for my new game, Arcade Simulator! 

# What is this game about?
In Arcade Simulator, you play as, well your own name, **In this story,** your dream job is to become an owner of an arcade! But, you gotta work your way up, of course.
Play minigames and do chores to get tokens! Tokens let you buy items, which lets you proceed in the game's story!

# One thing though...
I am not even close to finishing, which is sad. I have about 5% done, which isn't a lot.

# How do I help?
Well, I need a lot of ideas... Feel free to contact me on Discord or Github.

# Well what does it look like?
I have released a very early version. I know there is spelling mistakes, but this is legit my first version so YEAH.
